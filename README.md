Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test

### Answer to questions:

**1. To ensure effective sharing of DBT models with other teams, I would follow these simple steps:**

- Use Version Control: Keep track of all changes using version control like Git.

- Build Main Tables Upstream: Create core tables (e.g., 'events') in the upstream. This way, downstream users can make changes to their own models without affecting the source data.

- Consider Impact: Encourage downstream teams to assess the impact of their changes. Make sure they understand how changes may affect existing models.

- Regression Testing: Implement automatic testing of the entire data pipeline to catch and fix any issues that might crop up due to changes made by downstream teams.

- These steps help ensure controlled collaboration and minimize disruptions to the data pipeline..

**2. Data Trust and Documentation**
To ensure stakeholder trust in the data, I would take the following steps:

- Documentation: Provide clear documentation that explains the model's source and purpose. This helps stakeholders understand where the data comes from and what the model does.

- Data Quality Checks: Compare the model's output with established, trusted models. If differences are found, explain why they exist and provide evidence that the differences are expected.

- Consumer-Producer Contract: Clearly define the relationship between data producers and consumers. This helps others understand who is responsible for the model.

- Data Catalog: Implement data quality checks to ensure data integrity. Use tools like Great Expectations if possible, and alert stakeholders when data quality issues are detected.
